# Setting Up Your Development Environment

This week I got to install a fresh version of Ubuntu on my new machine. I want to record how I go about setting up my development environment here to save me the hassle of scratching my head and Googling around later. Here is, in a somewhat particular order, my dev essentials.

## Terminal

Setting up a terminal that is pleasing to look at is one of my creature comforts as a dev. Here is what I add to the `~/.bashrc` file.

```
# Colors and stuff here
```

## Vim

## Git

## Python

## Ruby

## Dev Tools

The following aid me in my development work on a daily basis:
- Postman
- VSCode
